This part of the project documentation focuses on a
**problem-oriented** approach. You'll tackle common
tasks that you might have, with the help of the code
provided in this project.

## So you need to roll some dice?

Perhaps the sound of physical dice in a cup infuriates those around you. No, you won't stop playing Yahtzee, no matter how loud it is! 

Using `DiceApp`, you can roll those same dice silently. Best of all, no one can accuse you of cheating. Your opponent can check the ASCII representations of each die for themselves, and there's none of that "one die accidentally getting knocked to a more favorable face" kind of action.

Download the code from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/rebeccabapaye/DiceApp) and run it through your shell/terminal to get started! 

## Making changes to the code

The `DiceApp` code currently operates with a number of dice only from 1 to 6, but if you need more, the code can be modified to suit your needs. [Here is a link to the tutorial.](https://realpython.com/python-dice-roll/)
